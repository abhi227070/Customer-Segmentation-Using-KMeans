# Customer-Segmentation-Using-KMeans

In this Project, I am using Google Colab to run the environment.
I import the dataset from Kaggle.
Further I imported the dependencies, analyze the data and preprocess the data.
In the model-building stage, First I plot the Elbow Chart to estimate the number of clusters and then build the model according to the Elbow Chart.
Lastly, I plot the scatterplot to validate the clusters that are segmented by the KMeans Cluster algorithm to segregate the customers.
In conclusion, we analyze the graph and identify the target customer for business analysis.
